# Daily Notes

Daily logging and reflection system. Each day gets its own note for tracking objectives, accomplishments, meetings, and learnings.

## Structure

Each daily note should include:
- **Daily objectives** and planned tasks
- **Accomplishments** and completed work
- **Meeting summaries** and key decisions
- **Task progress** and any blockers encountered
- **Mood and energy levels** for pattern tracking
- **Learnings** and insights gained
- **Tomorrow's priorities** for continuity

## Template Usage

Use the daily note template (`_templates/daily-note.md`) to create consistent daily logs. The template includes sections for all key daily tracking elements.

## Naming Convention

Daily notes should follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD - Daily Log.md`
Example: `2025-01-15 - Daily Log.md`

## Organization

Daily notes can be organized by:
- **Chronological order** - Natural date-based sorting
- **Weekly/Monthly reviews** - Regular pattern analysis
- **Mood tracking** - Using constants from `_constants/mood.md`
- **Work modes** - Different types of work days

## Integration

Daily notes should link to:
- **Tasks** worked on during the day
- **Projects** that received attention
- **Meetings** attended
- **People** interacted with

## Examples

Example daily note files (not included in this template):
- `2025-01-15 - Daily Log.md`
