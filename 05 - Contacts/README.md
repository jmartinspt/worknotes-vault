# Contacts

Contact information and relationship management. Organized storage for professional and personal contacts with relationship context and interaction history.

## Structure

Each contact note should include:
- **Basic information** (name, title, company, contact details)
- **Relationship context** (how you know them, relationship type)
- **Professional background** and expertise
- **Interaction history** and important conversations
- **Projects or tasks** they're involved with
- **Personal notes** and preferences
- **Follow-up reminders** and next actions

## Template Usage

Use the contact template (`_templates/contact-template.md`) to create structured contact records. This ensures consistent information capture and easy reference.

## Organization

Contacts can be organized by:
- **Company or organization** - Create sub-folders for major organizations
- **Relationship type** - Colleagues, clients, vendors, etc.
- **Project association** - People involved in specific projects
- **Frequency of interaction** - Regular contacts vs. occasional

## Sub-folders

Create sub-folders for major organizations or teams:
- `Other teams/` - Contacts within Other teams organization
- `Vendors/` - External service providers
- `Team/` - Internal team members

## Integration

Contact notes should link to:
- **Projects** the person is involved with
- **Meetings** where they were present
- **Tasks** they're responsible for or involved with
