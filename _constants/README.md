### Team (`team.md`)
Team member definitions and roles for easy reference and linking.

### Mood (`mood.md`)
Mood tracking options for daily notes and personal reflection.

### Mode (`mode.md`)
Work mode classifications to categorize different types of work sessions.

## Usage

These constants are designed to be used in:
- **Template dropdowns** - For consistent data entry
- **Dataview queries** - For filtering and aggregation
- **Tag systems** - For organization and search
- **Status tracking** - For progress monitoring

## Customization

Modify these files to match your organization's specific needs:
1. Add new status types as your workflow evolves
2. Update priority levels to match your system
3. Include your team members in the team constants
4. Customize mood and mode options for your tracking preferences

## Best Practices

- **Keep it simple** - Don't overcomplicate with too many options
