## Quick Actions

Each dashboard includes **➕ Add buttons** powered by the Meta Bind plugin for rapid content creation:

- **One-click creation** - Create new items directly from dashboard views
- **Template integration** - Automatically uses appropriate templates for each content type
- **Seamless workflow** - No need to navigate to folders or remember template locations
- **Consistent structure** - Ensures all new items follow proper formatting and organization

**Required Plugin**: Meta Bind (for add button functionality)
