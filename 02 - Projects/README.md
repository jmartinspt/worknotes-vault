# Projects

Project planning, tracking, and documentation. Each project gets comprehensive planning documentation with objectives, timelines, resources, and progress tracking.

## Structure

Each project note should include:
- **Project overview** and objectives
- **Timeline** and key milestones
- **Team members** and responsibilities
- **Resource allocation** and budget considerations
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Progress tracking** and status updates
- **Deliverables** and success criteria

## Template Usage

Use the project template (`_templates/project-template.md`) to create structured project documentation. This ensures consistency and completeness across all projects.

## Organization

Projects can be organized by:
- **Status** - Active, Planning, On Hold, Completed
- **Priority** - Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Team** - Different teams or departments
- **Timeline** - Sprint cycles, quarters, or phases

## Sub-folders

- `_attachments/` - Project-specific files and resources
- Individual project folders can be created for large projects with multiple components

## Examples

Example project files (not included in this template):
- `BMW Prime.md` - Major feature implementation
- `Security Compliance Q4.md` - Quarterly compliance project
- `Mobile App Redesign.md` - UI/UX improvement initiative
